Much of the research work takes place on a computer. Even without conducting complex calculations or analyses, tasks involving writing, reading, discussing, and collecting data and information happen in a computational environment. Technological advancements are now so quickly incorporated into everyday work tools that the line between the actual human work and the environment in which it happens becomes more elusive. An example is exploring the state-of-the-art in a given field. While now it can be assisted with AI tools, finding the essential information, the cracks in knowledge and (sometimes far-fetched) connotations to other domains depend on a deep comprehension of a subject and the expertise lens of a researcher.

Research work has many aspects. It joins the domain knowledge with technological literacy and emotional agility. My motivation for launching this space is to collect and share my experiences with tools and models that help me do the research work and make it more enjoyable, efficient, and... easier. Many projects published here are about processes, systems, and work around work. I hope it will also help you in your tasks and invite you to the discussion on creating an essential and sustainable research environment.
